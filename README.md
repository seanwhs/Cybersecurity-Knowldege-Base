# 🧠 Cybersecurity Knowledge Base — Enterprise Domain Architecture

**Enterprise Cognitive Security Operating System (CSOS)**

**Version:** 1.0 — Enterprise Cognitive Security Architecture
**Author:** Sean Wong
**Date:** January 2026

# 📖 Executive Overview

This repository defines a **production-grade cybersecurity knowledge architecture**, engineered as a **living cognitive security operating system**, not static documentation.

It represents a **converged platform** for:

> **Security architecture, threat intelligence, detection engineering, adversary simulation, SOC operations, governance, and executive decision support.**

This system is designed to function as:

* A **strategic security architecture framework**
* A **threat reasoning engine**
* A **SOC operational playbook**
* A **hands-on cyber range & simulation environment**
* A **long-term cybersecurity career knowledge base**

Rather than siloed security disciplines, this repository treats cybersecurity as a **coherent, end-to-end engineered system** spanning:

```
Identity → Access → Workloads → Networks → Data → Telemetry → Detection → Response → Governance
```

This approach enables **systemic security posture engineering** rather than control-driven compliance.

# 🎯 Strategic Vision

> **Build a Cybersecurity Cognitive Operating System (CSOS)**
> — capable of reasoning holistically across **architecture, identity, risk, adversaries, controls, telemetry, response, and governance.**

This platform models cybersecurity as:

| Layer                  | Purpose                                                              |
| ---------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Cognitive Layer**    | Strategic reasoning, threat modeling, architectural decision support |
| **Architecture Layer** | Zero Trust, Identity-first, cloud-native secure system design        |
| **Operational Layer**  | SOC detection, incident response, cyber defense operations           |
| **Adversarial Layer**  | Red team simulation, breach modeling, attack emulation               |
| **Governance Layer**   | Risk, compliance, audit, executive visibility                        |

---

# 🌍 Standards & Framework Alignment

This system aligns deeply with:

* **NIST SP 800-53 / 61 / 92 / 207 (Zero Trust)**
* **ISO 27001 / 27002**
* **CIS Controls v8**
* **OWASP Top 10 / ASVS / MASVS**
* **MITRE ATT&CK & D3FEND**
* **Cloud Security Alliance (CSA) CCM**
* **SANS Detection Engineering & SOC methodologies**

Unlike compliance-only repositories, this system **operationalizes standards into architecture, detection logic, and attack simulations.**

# 🏗 Enterprise Architecture Philosophy

## Identity-First Security Architecture

At its core, this platform implements **Identity as the new perimeter**:

```
User → Device → Identity → Context → Policy → Access → Telemetry → Continuous Verification
```

### Core Principles:

* Zero implicit trust
* Continuous authentication & authorization
* Policy-driven access control
* Real-time telemetry feedback loops
* Threat-aware access enforcement

```

Security decisions continuously adapt based on **live telemetry and threat intelligence**.
