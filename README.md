# 🧠 Cybersecurity Knowledge Base — Enterprise Domain Architecture

**Version:** 1.0 — Enterprise Cognitive Security Architecture  
**Author:** Sean Wong  
**Date:** January 2026

---

## 📖 Overview

This repository is a **complete enterprise-grade cybersecurity knowledge base**, designed not as static documentation, but as a **living technical reference, engineering playbook, training platform, operational framework, and architectural decision engine**.

It unifies:

- Security Architecture  
- Zero Trust & Identity-First Design  
- Secure-by-Design & Secure-by-Default Engineering  
- Privacy-by-Design  
- Adversary-Centric Security Operations  

into a **single, cohesive framework** supporting:

> **Engineering, Architecture, Operations, Compliance, and Executive Security Strategy.**

This system aligns with globally recognized standards:

- **NIST 800-53, 800-61, 800-92, SP 800-207 (Zero Trust)**  
- **ISO 27001 / 27002**  
- **CIS Controls v8**  
- **OWASP Top 10, ASVS, MASVS**  
- **MITRE ATT&CK**  
- **Cloud Security Alliance (CSA)**  

---

## 🎯 Objectives

This knowledge base is intended to become:

- A **career-long technical reference**  
- A **Zero Trust & security architecture decision-support system**  
- A **threat modeling & detection engineering platform**  
- A **SOC operations & incident response playbook system**  
- A **hands-on lab, simulation & adversary emulation framework**  

### Core Vision

> Build a **Cybersecurity Cognitive Operating System** — reasoning holistically about **architecture, risk, threats, controls, telemetry, response, and governance**.
